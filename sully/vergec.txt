The following is a list of the specific commands, functions, and
variables that are supported by VergeC, VERGE's event scripting
language. This document does NOT explain the basic principles of
VergeC, nor does it explain how to add events to your map. That
information in located in VERGEDOC.TXT, Chapter 2.
=======================================================

Chapter 1: Commands
----------------------------------------------
  Section 1: Movement
  Section 2: Party, Item, and Game Management
  Section 3: Sound
  Section 4: Text and Prompts
  Section 5: Environmental Manipulation
  Section 6: VergeC Event Control
  Section 7: Gratuitous Eye Candy
  Section 8: VergeC Graphic Layer Controls
  Section 9: Entities
  Section 10: The Startup Script
----------------------------------------------

Section 1: Movement

Warp(x coordinate, y coordinate, no fade);
------------------------------------------
Example: Warp(29,15,0);
This will move the party to a new location in the current map. If you supply
a 1 for the no-fade parameter, then the travel will be instantaneous.
Otherwise, a brief fade out and fade in will accompany the warp.
If your event has other commands after the Warp command, they will execute
after the party reaches their destination.

MapSwitch("map file name",x coordinate, y coordinate, no fade);
---------------------------------------------------------------
Example: MapSwitch("ICECAVE.MAP",31,12,0);
This will move the party to a new map. If you supply a 0 for both the x and
y coordinate, then the party will appear at the new map's START POSITION.
(edited in the Map Properties window). If you supply a 1 for the no-fade
parameter, the travel will be instantaneous. Otherwise, a brief fade out
and fade in will accompany the switch. Realize that all commands in your
event after a MapSwitch will NOT be executed. To have events execute after
a MapSwitch, you will need to place them in the AutoExec event of the
destination map.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2: Party, Item, and Game Management

!!! New !!! 
StatusScreen(roster order index);
-----------------------------
Example: StatusScreen(3);
This will invoke the built in status screen for the character in the given 
party roster order. 

AddCharacter(party.dat index);
------------------------------
Example: AddCharacter(3);
This will add the specified character to the current adventuring group,
provided the party currently has less than 5 members.

RemoveCharacter(party.dat index);
---------------------------------
Example: RemoveCharacter(3);
If the specified character is currently in the active party, they will leave
and be removed from the group.

GiveXP(character, amount);
--------------------------
Example: GiveXP(7,500);
This will add the amount of experience points to a character's current total.
The character reference is from PARTY.DAT. After this event is run, the
character's level will increase if they have sufficient experience points.

ChangeCHR(character, "chr file name");
--------------------------------------
Example: ChangeCHR(4,"KNIGHT.CHR");
This will permanently which CHR file is associated with the specified
character, immediately changing their walking graphics.

HealAll();
----------
This will restore the Hit Points, Magic Points, and Condition of all the
characters currently in the active party.

GiveGP(amount);
---------------
Example: GiveGP(500);
This adds the specified amount of money to the party's current amount.

TakeGP(amount);
---------------
Example: TakeGP(200);
This removes the specified amount of money from the party's current amount.

GiveItem(items.dat index);
--------------------------
Example: GiveItem(12);
This will give the specified item to the character currently in the front
of the party, displaying the item's icon and name briefly.

DestroyItem(items.dat index, character);
----------------------------------------
Example: DestroyItem(12,0);
This will destroy the specified item and remove it from the specified
character's inventory. A 0 in either field will be interpreted as "all":
(12,4)- Destroys specific item from specific character's inventory.
(12,0)- Destroys specific item from all characters' inventories.
(0,4) - Destroys all items from specific character's inventory.
(0,0) - Destroys all items from all characters' inventories.

GetItem(items.dat index, character);
------------------------------------
Example: GetItem(18,2);
This is similar to GiveItem, but you may specify which character receives
the item, and the name and icon box does not appear. This is most useful for
giving characters inventories that they carry before joining the group.

!!! New !!!
GetMagic(character, magic.dat index);
------------------------------------
Example: GetMagic(1,4);
This is similar to GetItem, but works for magic. A character will not recieve
a spell that they already posess, and may not recieve more spells than fit
in the magic menu (24). This is mainly used in giving characters spells on
startup, or for plot given magic during the game. However, no box appears to
signal this, so you must code one in vc if you wish it to be known to the
player (using simple text boxes, or through the new icon displaying commands)

ForceEquip(items.dat index, character);
---------------------------------------
Example: ForceEquip(10,1);
This equips the specified character with the specified item. If the item does
not exist in that character's inventory, it will be created and equipped.
This is useful for having new characters join the group with items already
equipped.

Shop(item1, item2, item3, ... item12);
---------------------------------------
Example: Shop(14,12,27,3,5,9,20);
This will summon the shop window and allow the player to buy and sell items
until they exit the shop. The items available to buy are specified in the
Shop command's parameters. You need only include the items you wish to have
for sale, and may not offer more than 12 items in a single Shop event.

!!! New !!!
MagicShop(spell1, spell2, spell3, ... spell12);
---------------------------------------
Example: MagicShop(14,12,27,3,5,9,20);
This will summon the shop window and allow the player to buy and sell spells
until they exit the shop. The spells available to buy are specified in the
MagicShop command's parameters. You need only include the spells you wish to
have for sale, and may not offer more than 12 spells in a single MagicShop
event. A character may not buy a spell that they cannot use, or spells that
they already posess. Otherwise, a character may buy any spell offered.

Exit();
-------
This will leave the current game and return to the title screen.

Quit(message);
-------
This will close VERGE altogether and return to the DOS prompt with the
specified message.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3: Sound

SoundEffect(main.sfx index);
----------------------------
Example: SoundEffect(7);
This plays the specified sound effect. Note that sound effects always play
at their maximum volume, despite the Volume variable.

PlayMusic("file name");
-----------------------
Example: PlayMusic("AURORA.MOD");
This starts the specified music module file.

StopMusic();
------------
This commands stops the music and disables the sound effects. To play sound
effects while the music is stopped, it is recommended you set the Volume
variable to 0(see Variables in Chapter 2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4: Text and Prompts

!!! New !!! 
TextMenu(x coordinate, y coordinate, flag, default, "choice1","choice2",..);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: TextMenu(4,4,0,0,"Item", "Equip", "Magic","Status","Order","Tactic");
This command will print a menu at the given coordinates, setting Flags[flag]
to the number of the option chosen or zero if the menu was cancelled. The text
that is displayed for the options are listed starting at the fourth parameter.
Setting default to a value of n will initially position the menu pointer on
the nth option. You can have as many options as you like provided that the 
menu does not go off the boundaries of the screen.

!!! New !!! 
ItemMenu(roster order index);
-----------------------------
Example: ItemMenu(1);
This will invoke the built in item menu for the character in the given party 
roster order. 

!!! New !!! 
EquipMenu(roster order index);
-----------------------------
Example: EquipMenu(3);
This will invoke the built in equip menu for the character in the given party 
roster order. 

!!! New !!!
MagicMenu(roster order index);
-----------------------------
Example: MagicMenu(3);
This will invoke the built in magic menu for the character in the given party 
roster order. 

Text(speech portrait, "line1", "line2", "line3");
-------------------------------------------------
Example: Text(3,"I am the mighty dragon slayer",
                "Felgar! I have come to save",
                "your wretched little village!");
This will display the main dialogue box with the specified text. All of the
text will be displayed immediately. Please note that the maximum number of
characters per line is 30. Your event will compile if it exceeds 30, but it
will be alarmingly unattractive when the game executes. The speech portrait
is in reference to the images in SPEECH.SPC. Note that spacing in a text
event is not important, but the above example shows how it can be done in
a tidy and readable manner. The text box will vanish once the player hits
a key.

SText(speech portrait, "line1", "line2", "line3");
--------------------------------------------------
Example: SText(3,"I am the mighty dragon slayer",
                 "Felgar! I have come to save",
                 "your wretched little village!");
This is identical to a regular Text event, except the letters will print out
one at a time in a scrolling fashion. A key press will make the text box
disappear, even if the text has not finished printing yet. Note that SText
is still a bit uncertain on slower machines, but will most likely be
stable in the future.

Prompt(speech portrait, "line1", "line2", "line3", flag, "choice1", "choice2");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: Prompt(0,"I'm a great fighter and I'm",
                  "pretty studly too! Do you want",
                  "me to tag along with you?",45,"Sure!","Nope!");
This event will print out a text box in a similar manner to a Text statement,
but will then pass control to a small cursor window where the player must
make a selection between two options. The box will print the last two
parameters of the Prompt event as the choices. If the player selects the
first option, then the Flags[x] variable that the Prompt event references
will be assigned a value of 0. If the second option is selected, it will be
assigned a value of 1. It is common to follow a Prompt event with an
IF statement to evaluate the effects of the decision.

Banner("message", duration);
----------------------------
Example: Banner("The key works!",3);
This will display a small window in the center of the screen with the
specified message. The Banner will disappear when the player presses a key,
or after the specified number of seconds elapses. The message for the
Banner should not exceed 16 characters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5: Environmental Manipulation

AlterBTile(x coordinate, y coordinate, new tile, obstruction value);
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: AlterBTile(62,14,382,1);
This will alter one tile in the current map's background layer.
The new tile parameter references a tile graphic from the map's VSP.
The obstruction value can be set to 0(non-obstructed), 1(obstructed),
or 2(remains the same). It is very important to note that these changes
will be LOST when the player exits the maps. If you wish the change to be
permanent, you will need to add an event in the map's AutoExec to alter
the tile when the map is entered.

AlterFTile(x coordinate, y coordinate, new tile, obstruction value);
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: AlterFTile(62,14,382,1);
This works identically to AlterBTile, except that it alters a tile in the
map's foreground layer as opposed to the background layer.

ChangeZone(x coordinate, y coordinate, new zone);
-------------------------------------------------
ChangeZone(62,14,9);
This will change the zone number associated with a tile. Like AlterBTile
and AlterFTile events, this change is NOT permanent and must be kept track
of in the map's AutoExec event to be consistent when the map is left and
re-entered.

AlterParallax(parallax control mode, multiplier, divisor);
----------------------------------------------------------
Example: AlterParallax(2,3,2);
This will re-configure the map's Parallax and layer attributes. Refer to
VERGEDOC.TXT on how the control mode and multiplier/divisor work. Again,
this change is not permanent and will be forgotten when the map is exited.

EnforceAnimation();
-------------------
This command should be in EVERY map's AutoExec that uses a VSP with at least
one animation strand. It ensures that the map's animated tiles animate when
the map is first loaded. You should NOT use this command in a map if the
map's VSP contains no animation data, however.

DisableMenu();
--------------
This will prevent the player from accessing the gameplay menu. However, the
system menu can still be accessed. Mostly used for semi-interactive sequences
in games.

EnableMenu();
-------------
This command will undo a DisableMenu command.

DisableSave();
--------------
This will prevent the player from saving his game. However, the system menu
can still be accessed to load games, change volume, quit, etc.

EnableSave();
-------------
This will undo a DisableSave event, or allow the player the save his game in
a map specified as non-saveable.

SaveMenu();
-----------
This command will summon the Savegame menu and allow the player to save his
game. This will not affect whether or not the save menu is accessible
through the system menu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 6: VergeC Event Control

Return;
-------
This command will abort all current VergeC event processing and return
control to the engine. Most useful in mutually exclusive conditional events.

WaitKeyUp();
------------
This will halt the current event execution until the player releases any
depressed keys. This is most useful in events that are activated through
Adjacent Activation, and can be repeatedly executed. If this command is not
present in such an event, the event will be activated *many* times with a
single key press.

ReadControls();
---------------
This command will update the player's control variables (up, down, left, right,
b1, b2, b3, b4). Any direction or button not depressed will be assigned a
value of 0, and any direction or button that is depressed will be assigned
a value of 1. See Variables in Chapter 2 to better understand the eight
control variables.

ChainEvent(event number, optional variable 1, optional variable 2, etc.);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: ChainEvent(42,2,2,9,51);
This command requires only one parameter, but may use more. It will pass
all event execution control to the destination event. If more parameters
are provided, their values will immediately be assigned to Var(0), Var(1),
Var(2), etc. respectively. See the VergeC section of VERGEDOC.TXT for more
information on how to effectively use ChainEvent. Note that once you pass
control to an event using ChainEvent, it is up to the destination event
to handle VergeC processing. The commands listed immediately after the
ChainEvent will not occur.

CallEvent(event number, optional variable 1, optional variable 2, etc.);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: CallEvent(42,2,2,9,51);
This command works identically to ChainEvent, except that once the destination
event has been executed, VergeC will pass control back to the line immediately
beneath the original CallEvent command.

!!! New !!! 
CallEffect(effect number, optional variable 1, optional variable 2, etc.);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: CallEffect(2,3,1,0);
This works similarly to CallEvent but will run the appropriate VC script in 
the EFFECTS.VCS file. The value of the temporary variables (a-z) are saved
before the script is run and restored when the script has finished running.
If you wish to pass values back from the effects script use flags.

!!! New !!! 
CallScript(script number, optional variable 1, optional variable 2, etc.);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: CallScript(4,3,2);
This works similarly to CallEffect but will run the appropriate VC script in 
the STARTUP.VCS file.

HookTimer(event number);
------------------------
Example: HookTimer(17);
This powerful command will cause the VERGE engine to call a certain event
every single time the timer ticks, which is 100 times a second. This command
must be used with extreme care, but is capable of a wide array of interesting
functions if done so. The destination event must not include ANY commands
that require player input, or would otherwise slow the game down for more
than a fraction of a second. The commands you use in the destination event
must only include such instantaneous things as AlterBTile, AlterFTile,
SoundEffect, and variable assignments. The most common use of a timer-hooked
event is to make something happen at regular time intervals. Your destination
event could look like this:
{
 if(timer=500)
 {
  SoundEffect(12);
  Timer=0;
 }
}
Provided you set the Timer variable to 0 before hooking this event, each time
the Timer variable reaches 500, which would happen in 5 seconds, the sound
effect would play, then Timer would be reset to 0, and the sound effect would
play in another 5 seconds. To turn off a Timer-hooked script, use this
command with a 0 parameter, ie. HookTimer(0); Be sure to shut it off in
such a manner before calling a MapSwitch.

HookRetrace(event number);
--------------------------
Example: HookRetrace(17);
This is mostly identical to HookTimer above, but this causes the destination
event to be called each time the screen updates, which does not necessarily
happen 100 times a second on all but the fastest machines. Since this causes
the hooked event to let the screen keep up with it, HookRetrace is in many
ways more stable than HookTimer. You may use the Timer variable to control
the hooked event, but realize that the event will not be called each timer
tick, but most likely every other tick, or approximately in that whereabouts.
The above sound effect example for HookTimer would need to use
IF(Timer>500) instead of IF(Timer=500) as the chance of the event being
called right when Timer is equal to 500 is quite uncertain. As with Hook
Timer, use a 0 to turn it off, ie. HookRetrace(0); Again, be sure to do
this before calling a MapSwitch or both vecna and I will come to your
house, beat you senseless, and steal the computer you are not worthy of.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 7: Gratuitous Eye Candy

!!! New !!!
PlayVAS ("VAS filename", delay, width, height, x coordinate, y coordinate);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: PlayVAS ("animate.pcx", 5, 320, 200, 0, 0);
This plays a VAS animation. VAS animations are compiled from FLIs or FLCs
using a utility by Ric that is available in DEVUTIL.ZIP.
Delay specifies how long to wait between drawing each frame (see duration for
the command FadeIn below). To actually see the animation you must switch on
the VC layer. The size of each VAS animation frame is given by the width and
height parameters and the animation will be played back at the given x and y
coordinates on the VC layer. Note that the animation will be loaded into
the VC data buffer so should not be larger than it (to find out how large the
VC data buffer needs to be multiply width x height x number of frames).
Make sure to apply to verge palette to the VAS after it is made.
This will clear the memory in which pcx's are loaded, so be warned.

FadeIn(duration);
-----------------
Example: FadeIn(30);
This will cause the screen to fade from black to normal. The duration is how
quickly it fades. 30 is typical, while something like 150 is a bit more
prolonged.

FadeOut(duration);
------------------
Example: FadeOut(30);
Fades the screen from normal to black. Duration works in a similar fashion to
FadeIn.

BoxFadeIn(duration);
--------------------
Example: BoxFadeIn(50);
This will cause the screen to 'open up' from the center, with a retreating
black frame. The duration works in a similar manner to a FadeIn.

BoxFadeOut(duration);
---------------------
Example: BoxFadeOut(50);
This will cause the screen to 'close' from all sides with a constricting
black frame. Duration works like BoxFadeIn.

Earthquake(x intensity, y intensity, duration);
-----------------------------------------------
Example: Earthquake(10,10,300);
This command rattles the screen around for as long as the duration lasts.
The intensity is in number of pixels, so bear in mind that each 16 points
of intensity will make one border tile visible during the earthquake.

Redraw();
---------
Forces the VERGE engine to update the screen. Usually any changes to tiles,
VC graphic layer, etc. do not appear until control is returned to the
game engine. This is most useful when you want some animation type things
to occur directly after a MapSwitch.

Wait(duration);
---------------
Example: Wait(100);
Causes the game to 'halt' for the duration in 1/100 fractions of a second.
Note that the player cannot do anything during this time, although animated
tiles and timer-hooked scripts will still work normally.

SetFace(character, direction);
------------------------------
Example: SetFace(2,3);
This will change the direction a character is facing. The character reference
is by the current party roster order, not by PARTY.DAT. If you wish to
reference a certain character, you may use the Char(x) function. For
example, you can make Darin face up, no matter where he is in the group
with SetFace(char(1),1);  The facing references are 0-down, 1-up, 2-right,
3-left.

PaletteMorph(red, green, blue, intensity, lighting);
----------------------------------------------------
Example: PaletteMorph(10,10,45,50,60);
This command will alter the entire game palette, affecting the entire
screen. To change the color 'tint' of the screen, use the RGB values of
the color you wish to affect the screen with. These RGB values go from
0 to 63, so 63,0,0 is red, 0,63,0 is green, 0,0,63 is blue, 0,0,0 is black,
63,63,63 is white, and 63,63,0 is yellow. The intensity is how 'thick' the
color appears on the screen. This is value from 0 to 100. O would not be
visible at all, and 100 would make the screen solid color. Finally, the
lighting parameter is a value from 0 to 63. The game engine is usually at
63, while 0 is black.  To recover from a morphed Palette and return to the
regular game colors, simply run this command again with an Intensity of 0.

MapPaletteGradient(start color, end color, invert, mode);
---------------------------------------------------------
Example: MapPaletteGradient(152,159,1,0);
This is a powerful command that will alter one or more aspects of the
game's graphics to a 'gradient' of colors, maintaining the luminance of
the artwork, but forcing it all into shades of one hue. Mode 0 will affect
the entire screen, save for the windows and menu artwork, and Mode 1 will
affect the text, menu, and information windows. To select which color you
wish to use, choose your start and end values from the table below.
If you see (I) next to the gradient you wish to use, then enter a 1 for
the MapPaletteGradient command's invert parameter. Otherwise, enter a 0.

VERGE Palette Gradients
(I) = Use inverted mode
() = Is reasonably useful (ie. not an eyesore)

0-7 = Very Dark Greyscale
8-15 = Dark Greyscale()
16-23 = Greyscale
24-31 = Light Greyscale
32-39 = Dark Red(I)
40-47 = Dark Brown(I)()
48-55 = Light Red(I)
56-63 = Dark Brown()
64-71 = Light Yellow(I)
72-79 = Dark Yellow(I)()
80-87 = Forest Green(I)
88-95 = Light Green(I)
96-103 = Dark Green(I)
104-111 = Very Dark Green(I)()
112-119 = Cyan(I)
120-127 = Dark Cyan(I)()
128-135 = Periwinkle(I)
136-143 = Blue(I)
144-151 = Dark Blue(I)
152-159 = Nighttime Blue(I)()
160-167 = Dark Brown()
168-175 = Mahogany
176-182 = Tan
184-191 = Brown
192-199 = Flesh(I)
200-207 = Dark Flesh(I)
208-215 = Brown(I)
216-223 = Dark Brown(I)()
224-231 = Red
232-239 = Orange
240-247 = Orange/Brown(I)()
248-254 = Purple
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 8: VergeC Graphic Layer Controls

There is now a second VC graphics layer which operates in a similar way
to the first. See the VCLayerWrite and LayerVC2 variables below for more
details.

!!! New !!! 
VCBox(x coordinate1, y coordinate1, x coordinate2, y coordinate2);
------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCBox(104,101,314,194);
This draws a bordered translucent blue box (like the one that the default
menus use) on the VC layer. The first set of coordinates specified will be 
the upper left corner of the box, and the second set will be the lower 
right corner.

!!! New !!! 
VCCharName(x coordinate, y coordinate, party.dat index, align);
VCItemName(x coordinate, y coordinate, items.dat index, align);    
VCItemDesc(x coordinate, y coordinate, items.dat index, align);    
VCSpellName(x coordinate, y coordinate, magic.dat index, align);    
VCSpellDesc(x coordinate, y coordinate, magic.dat index, align);    
---------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCCharName(20,30,1,0);
This command will use the small font to print a text string directly onto
the VergeC graphic layer. The align flag is used to determine how the x
coordinate is used. A value of zero will print the text as "left 
justified", 1 will print the text centered around the x coordinate and a 
value of 2 will print the text as "right justified".
  VCCharName will print the name of the character specified.
  VCItemName will print the name of the item specified.
  VCItemDesc will print the description of the item specified.
  VCSpellName will print the name of the spell specified.
  VCSpellDesc will print the description of the spell specified.

!!! New !!! 
VCItemImage(x coordinate, y coordinate, items.dat index, greyflag);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCItemImage(30,40,2,0);
This will draw the icon of the item specified onto the VC layer at the 
given coordinates. A value of 1 for greyflag will greyscale the image. 
Use a value of 0 for greyflag to display the image normally.

!!! New !!!
VCSpellImage(x coordinate, y coordinate, items.dat index, greyflag);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCSpellImage(30,40,2,0);
This will draw the icon of the spell specified onto the VC layer at the 
given coordinates. A value of 1 for greyflag will greyscale the image. 
Use a value of 0 for greyflag to display the image normally.

!!! New !!!
VCTextBox(x coordinate, y coordinate, pointer, "choice1","choice2",..);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: TextMenu(4,4,0,0,"Item", "Equip", "Magic","Status","Order","Tactic");
This command will print a list of text at the given coordinates. If pointer is
set a value n other than 0 then the pointer will be drawn next to the nth item
in the list. You can have as many items listed as you like provided that the
menu does not go off the boundaries of the screen.

!!! New !!! 
VCCr2(x coordinate, y coordinate, roster order index, greyflag);
----------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCr2(4, 4, 1, 0);
This will draw the CR2 associated with the character in the given party roster
order onto the VC layer at the given coordinates. It will be drawn normally 
with a greyflag value of 0. A value of 1 for greyflag will greyscale the CR2.

!!! New !!! 
VCSpc(x coordinate, y coordinate, speech portrait, greyflag);
-------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCSpc(10, 20, 1, 0);
This will draw the specified speech portrait onto the VC layer at the
given coordinates. It will be drawn normally with a greyflag value of 0.
A value of 1 for greyflag will cause the speech portrait to be greyscaled.

VCPutPCX("pcx file name", x coordinate, y coordinate);
------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCPutPCX("DRAGON.PCX",125,50);
This will load the specified PCX image file and paste it onto the VergeC
graphic layer. Note that the image will not be immediately visible unless
the VergeC layer has been turned on. See Variables in Chapter 2 below.
Since this accesses the disk, it is recommended that you only use this
command for single images that are to be loaded once, as opposed to small
images that are loaded several times in animation sequences.

VCLoadPCX("pcx file name", memory offset);
------------------------------------------
Example: VCLoadPCX("FIREBALL.PCX",256);
This will load an image into the VergeC graphic layer's memory buffer. Once
the image is loaded, it can be dispayed with Blit commands many times rapidly
without having to access the disk each time. The memory offset is the
'location' in memory in which to store the image. One must be careful to
not overlap the offsets and jumble up the loaded images. If you multiply
the X dimension and Y dimension of your image, you will discover the size
of the buffer you need to allocate for your image. For example, if you
load a 16x16 PCX at memory offset 0, your next image should use memory
offset 256(16x16=256).

VCBlitImage(x coordinate, y coordinate, width, height, memory offset);
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCBlitImage(200,85,16,16,256);
This will display an image that has been previously stored using the
VCLoadPCX command. Specify where on the screen you wish the image to be
displayed, the size of the image, and at what memory offset you stored the
image in your previous VCLoadPCX command. Rendering images in this manner
is done directly from memory, and will thus be much cleaner and faster than
loading disk files with VCPutPCX.

VCTBlitImage(x coordinate, y coordinate, width, height, memory offset);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCTBlitImage(200,85,16,16,256);
This works just like VCBlitImage, but draws the picture 'transparently' over
both the map layers and the VergeC graphic layer itself, so that transparent
pixels will be ignored and will not 'destroy' currently rendered VergeC
graphic layer images.

VCText(x coordinate, y coordinate, "message");
----------------------------------------------
Example: VCText(80,92,"A long, long time ago...");
This command will use the small font to print a text message directly onto
the VergeC graphic layer. The message should not exceed 40 characters.

VCCenterText(y coordinate, "message");
--------------------------------------
Example: VCCenterText(92,"A long, long time ago...");
This command is similar to VCText, but centers the message horizontally, so
only a Y coordinate is required.

VCTextNum(x coordinate, y coordinate, number);
----------------------------------------------
Outputs the value of the specified number; good for testing the value of a
flag or something.

!!! New !!! 
VCATextNum(x coordinate, y coordinate, number, align);
------------------------------------------------------
Example: VCATextNum(20,30,a,0);
This is like the regular VCTextNum except that setting the align flag to
1 will center the text around the x coordinate while setting align to 2
will right justify the text.

VCClear();
----------
This command will clear all current contents of the VergeC graphic layer.

!!! New !!!
VCLine(x coordinate1, y coordinate1, x coordinate2, y coordinate2, color);
----------
This command draws a line between the first x and y coordinates and the
second coordinates in the color specified, onto the vc layer.

VCClearRegion(x coordinate1, y coordinate1, x coordinate2, y coordinate2);
----------------------------
Example: VCClearRegion(45,50,80,165);
This command will clear a rectangular region of the VergeC graphic layer.
The first set of coordinates specified will be the upper left corner of the
region, and the second set will be the lower right corner.

VCLoadRaw(filename, vc data buf offset, file start offset, length);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Loads raw data from a file into the VC data buffer.

Screen[x,y]
-----------
Type: read/write
Value: Simple is the pixel value of the specified pixel on the VC layer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 9: Entities

Controlling entities with VergeC is morely a matter of variables than
commands, however, there are several core commands which you will want to
get very familiar with:

PartyMove(movement script);
---------------------------
This makes the party move along the specified scripted path. It can use any
valid movement script commands besides 'B' (loop) or 'S' (call VC script).
This command is MUCH easier to make the party follow a complex path than using
the old hacked method of overriding user controls.

EntityMove(entity number, movement script);
-------------------------------------------
This feeds the specified movement script into the entity's brain. Unlike
PartyMove, the entity does not start the movement right away; the entity will
not begin moving until either the script aborts and control is returned to the
main engine or until a Wait() command is issued. So, if you use
EntityMove(5,"U3 D3"); and you want the script to pause until the entity
has completed that movement, then you could use:
While (movecode[5]) { Wait(10); }   Once the entity has completed it's course,
the script would resume. . Like PartyMove, you cannot use the 'B' (loop)
command.

EntityMoveScript(entity number, map movement script index number);
------------------------------------------------------------------
This sets the Entity's active movement script to the specific script index of
the map's script. Advantage over EntityMove: You can use any of the normal
commands, including looping.

AutoOn()/AutoOff();
-------------------
What's that, you say? You've mastered EntityMove and PartyMove, but there's one
problem: How do you make specific members of the party move around
individually? This is where AutoOn() and AutoOff() come in!

When you call AutoOn(), it sets drawparty to zero, so the REAL party disappears.
Then it makes 'copies' of the active party in entity slots 95 through 100.
You see, you should NEVER try to manipulate directly entities 0 through 4 besides
simple things like facing and specframe. Once you've called AutoOn tho, you can
use all of the various entity commands and variables on entities 95 through 100
which are clones of the party; if done correctly, there is no visible way to
tell if you are looking at the real party or the clones. Be sure to call
AutoOff() when you're done with them, however, or bad things will happen. :)

The following variables are key in manipulating how entities behave:

SpecialFrame(entity)
--------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This sets the active frame number (0-29) of entity, mostly used to
       display their optional frames. Set it to zero when you want the frame
       to return to normal.

Face(entity)
------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Sets the facing value for the specified entity.

Speed(entity)
-------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the speed the entity moves at. Normal player speed is 4. Valid
       values are 1 through 7. Altering the speed of entity 0 alters the active
       speed of the party.

MoveCode(entity)
----------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the Movement Code from the entity editor; ie, 0 for stopped,
       1 for Wander1, 4 for Scripted, etc.

ActiveMode(entity)
------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: 0=Entity needs to be "activated" in order for it's script to be called.
       1=Entity will activate itself when it is in the tile adjacent to the
         party leader.

ObsMode(entity)
---------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: 0=Obstructed by map obstructions, other entities, the player, etc.
       1=Ignores all obstructions.

Entity.Moving(entity)
---------------------
Type: Read only
Value: zero if stopped, nonzero if the entity is currently moving.

Entity.CHRindex(entity)
-----------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Sets the active CHR number associated with the specified entity.

Entity.Step(entity)
-------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Sets how many steps will be taken before Entity.Delay occurs.

Entity.Delay(entity)
--------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: The delay in ms (before adjusting for entity speed) that will occur
      in between the entity taking Entity.Step steps.

Entity.LocX(entity)
-------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: The x-axis location of the entity.

Entity.LocY(entity)
-------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: The y-axis location of the entity.

Entity.Face(entity)
-------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Toggles the "face player upon activation" flag of the entity.

Entity.Chasing(entity)
----------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: If 1, the entity will begin chasing the player when it is within
       Entity.Chasedist tiles of the player.

Entity.ChaseDist(entity)
------------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Controls how close the player must be to the entity before it begins
       chasing him.

Entity.ChaseSpeed(entity)
-------------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Determines the speed at which the entity will chase the player.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10: The Startup Script

There are a few things to remember when using startup.vc. First of all, you
should NEVER use Wait() in startup.. Instead, use Delay(ms); There is no map,
no party, no entities, so do not use any of those variables / commands or you
will screw things up pretty good. :) 

!!! New !!!
You can now use the VC layer in your startup.vc file. To do this you should
use Redraw() instead of VGAdump. Also remember to make the VC layer you are 
drawing to visible. 
Note: Unless you use Sys_DisplayPCX followed by a FadeIn at the start of your
      script the palette will not be set and your colors will be messed up.

Sys_ClearScreen();
------------------
Clears the screen. :)

Sys_DisplayPCX("filename.pcx");
-------------------------------
Loads the specified 320x200 PCX into the virtual screen.

OldStartupMenu();
-----------------
For those of you who don't want to use your OWN startup menu, you can just
let the old one do the work for you. You have a bit more flexibility coding
your own however.

VGAdump();
----------
Anything you do to the screen in startup.vc, such as a Sys_DisplayPCX, won't
actually happen to the screen until you copy the virtual screen to the real
screen, using this command.

NewGame("mapfile.map");
-----------------------
Starts a new game, loading the specified map as the starting point.

LoadMenu();
-----------
Executes the Load Game menu.

!!! New !!! 
BindKey(key code, script number);
---------------------------------
Example: BindKey(15, 1);
This command will cause the specified script number in startup.vcs to be run 
when the key referred to by key code is pressed. This can be used for calling 
custom menus and/or giving extra actions to the player. To cancel a bound key
pass a script number of zero (eg BindKey(15,0);). See Setup.doc for a list of
key codes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2: Variables
--------------------

These are the various game variables that VERGE uses in its normal execution.
You may read, and sometimes write, values of these variables in your
VergeC events. Below is a brief description of each:

!!! New !!! 
FontColor
---------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable controls what color all subsequent text in the small font 
       will be drawn as. This affects the built-in menus so be careful. 
       Defaults to 31.

!!! New !!! 
KeepAZ
------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable is included for compatibility. It controls whether or not
       CallEvent saves and restores the temporary variables like the new 
       CallEffect and CallScript commands do. By default this variable is set
       to 0 to preserve compatibility with previous VC scripts. 

Numchars
--------
Type: Read only
Value: Equal to the number of the characters currently in the party

GP
--
Type: Read/write
Value: The amount of money the party currently has

LocX
----
Type: Read only
Value: The horizontal location of the party leader in the current map

LocY
----
Type: Read only
Value: The vertical location of the party leader in the current map

Timer
-----
Type: Read/write
Value: This variable increases by 1 every 100th of a second. It is most
       commonly set to 0 before running a script that involves it.

DrawParty
---------
Type: Read/write
Value: If this value is 1, the characters are drawn on the screen. If it is
       0, the party is invisible. This variable has a default value of 1.

DrawEntities
------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Defaults to 1. When on, the entities are drawn. If it's zero, they are
       invisible.

CameraTracking
--------------
Type: Read/write
Value: If this value is 1, the screen will follow the player's movements. If
       it is 0, then the camera will not follow the party, and the XWin and
       YWin variables may be altered.

ForegroundLock
--------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: Defaults to 1; that is, the foreground simply follows the background,
       with parallax adjustment if applicable. If you turn this off, however,
       you can independently scroll the foreground with the Xwin1/ywin1
       variables.

XWin
----
Type: Read/write
Value: This is the horizontal offset of the screen when CameraTracking is
       off, in single pixels, ie. Saying XWin-=10 would make the screen's
       'focus' jump 10 pixels to the left.

YWin
----
Type: Read/write
Value: This is the vertical offset of the screen when CameraTracking is off.

XWin1/Ywin1
-----------
Same as xwin/ywin, but refer to the foreground layer specifically. (Only work
if foregroundlock is zero)

B1,B2,B3,B4
-----------
Type: Read/Write
Value: These are the variables that keep track of which buttons the player
       has depressed. When the button is depressed, it is assinged a value of
       1. Alternately, if a VergeC event assigns a button variable a value of
       1, the game will behave as though the player has pressed the button.

Up,Down,Left,Right
------------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: These are the variables the keep track of which directional controls
       the player is using. Setting these values to 1 will cause the player
       to move in the specified direction.

TimerAnimate
------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable should ONLY be set to 1 during animations that would
       otherwise halt tile animations. Be sure to reset the value of this
       variable to 0 after the animation is completed.

CurZone
-------
Type: Read Only
Value: Returns the current zone number the player is in.

TileB
-----
Type: Read Only
Value: Returns the tile index number the party leader is standing on (for the
       background layer).

TileF
-----
Type: Read Only
Value: Returns the tile index number the party leader is standing on (for the
       foreground layer).

Fade
----
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable controls whether or not Warps, MapSwitches, and other
       system fades like the Save/Load menu use fade-outs and fade-ins. It
       is set to 1 by default.

CancelFade
----------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is a bit different from fade: It doesn't turn fades on or off,
       rather, if you were to just say "cancelfade++", then the next fade and
       the next fade only would be cancelled. You could say Cancelfade+=3 and
       the next 3 fades would be aborted. This is much nicer for the purposes
       of Autoexecs and things than Fade is, since you don't need to turn it
       off afterwards.

Layer0
------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This controls if the background layer is visible. It is set to 1 by
       default.

Layer1
------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This controls if the foreground layer is visible. It is set to 1 by
       default.

!!! New !!! 
VCLayerWrite
------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This sets which VC layer subsequent VC layer commands (eg VCPutPCX) will
       draw to. It is set to 1 by default and has the following values:
       VCLayerWrite=1 - all subsequent vc layer commands are drawn to the first
                        VC layer.
       VCLayerWrite=2 - all subsequent vc layer commands are drawn to the second
                        VC layer.

LayerVC
-------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This controls if the first VergeC graphic layer is visible. Unlike 
       Layers 0 and 1, it is set to default 0. You should set this value to 0
       whenever the VergeC graphic layer is not necessary. It has the following
       values:
       LayerVC=1 draws the first VC layer on top of everything else.
       LayerVC=2 draws it under the foreground layer but on top of the chars
       LayerVC=3 draws it under both the foreground and the characters.

!!! New !!!
LayerVC2
--------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This controls if the second VergeC graphic layer is visible. It is drawn
       on top of the first layer if both layers are visible. Unlike Layers 0 and
       1, it is set to default 0. You should set this value to 0 whenever the 
       second VergeC graphic layer is not necessary. It has the following values:
       LayerVC2=1 draws the second VC layer on top of everything else.

Quake
-----
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable can be used to control perpetual earthquakes. When it is
       set to 1, the screen will shake continuously using the QuakeX and
       QuakeY variables until the Quake variable is set to 0.

QuakeX, QuakeY
--------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: These two variables control the horizontal and vertical intensities,
       respectively, of perpetual earthquakes that are performed when the
       Quake variable is set to 1.

ScreenGradient
--------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This variable controls if the alternate gradients invoked through
       MapPaletteGradient commands are in operation. Setting this value to
       0 will restore normal screen colors.

ParallaxC
---------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the current map's parallax control mode(0-3). Refer to
       VERGEDOC.TXT Chapter 1 to see how this affects your map layers.

PMultX, PDivX
-------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the multiplier and divisor that determines your map's parallax
       scrolling speeds when the player is moving horizontally.

PMultY, PDivY
-------------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the multiplier and divisor that determines your map's parallax
       scrolling speeds when the player is moving vertically.

Volume
------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the current music volume(0-100).

!!! New !!!
ModPosition
-----------
Type: Read/Write
Value: This is the current position in the MOD/S3M/XM currently playing.

ATK, DEF, HIT, DOD, MAG, MGR, REA, MBL, FER (party.dat index)
-------------------------------------------------------------
All of these variables take a party.dat index, and will return the current
stat value for the specified stat / party member, post equipment modifiers.
Read only.

layer1trans, layervctrans, layervc2trans
----------------------------------------
These control the transparency settings for the foreground layer and VC
graphics layer. For each variable, the settings are as follows:
0=no transparency (opaque) 1=standard transparency 2=inverse-order transparency

FUNCTIONS
=========

Obs(x,y)
